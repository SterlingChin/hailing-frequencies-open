# Sannr project API knowledge

Sannr is the librarian for this repo's APIs, and this folder is the shelf: the things a teammate or a coding agent found out about the APIs this code talks to, kept beside the code so they don't leave when the person who knew them does. The job is plain: an agent writes a lesson down while it works, and the next one reads it before it starts. There's no account and no Sannr server; these files are all there is, and the paths below follow this project's name and collection settings.

| Repository-relative path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.sannr/stacks/<name>/stack.json` | Committed API configuration, environments and credential references. |
| `.sannr/defaults.json` | Optional committed client defaults and default_stack. |
| `.sannr/stacks/<name>/sannr.json` | Committed API knowledge: operations, observations, and authored lessons. |
| `.sannr/stacks/.sannr-graph.json` | Committed graph configuration and provider bindings. |
| `.sannr/stacks/graph.snapshot.json` | Committed cross-repository graph snapshot, when exported. |
| `.sannr/stacks/suites/` | Committed request suites and import provenance. |
| `.sannr/stacks/api-audit-baseline.json` | Committed accepted audit findings. |
| `.sannr/vendor/sannr-ci.tgz` | Vendored engine package, when CI is explicitly installed. |
| `.sannr/skills/` | Canonical skills, copied into each agent host. |
| `.sannr/evidence/<name>/` | Private local request evidence; ignored by Git. |

Commit the knowledge, configuration, this guide, and the skill sources. Keep
credentials in environment variables: configuration stores their names, never
secret values. Recorded knowledge contains field names and types, and only
contract-declared enum values. Captured request and response evidence can contain
private values, so the local evidence directory is excluded by this directory's
own `.gitignore`; do not force-add it.

The instruction pointers in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, host registrations in
`.mcp.json` and `.codex/`, and CI workflows under `.github/workflows/` remain in
the locations their hosts read. They point back here. Skills here are the
source of truth; the host copies are installed by `./node_modules/.bin/sannr connect`.

Run `./node_modules/.bin/sannr doctor` to inspect the setup, `./node_modules/.bin/sannr show "GET /example"` to read
one operation, and `./node_modules/.bin/sannr migrate --dry-run` to preview an existing installation's
move into named API stacks or a product or collection rename. Inspect the plan,
run `./node_modules/.bin/sannr migrate` with any selected `--name` and `--split` options, then run
`./node_modules/.bin/sannr connect`. Migration refuses conflicting destinations and can be run
again safely. Unassigned knowledge stays in `unsorted`; use
`./node_modules/.bin/sannr stack move --to <stack> "<METHOD /path>"` to file an operation.
The generated guide uses repository-relative paths
so another person can read it on their own machine.
